# Store
http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Store.html
A store holds the whole state tree of your application.

# State
http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html#state
State (also called the state tree) is a broad term

# Action
Action to change state
Action is only way to get data into the state

# Reducer
Reducer is a function
type Reducer<S, A> = (state: S, action: A) => S

# Dispatching Function
Dispatch sends an action to the store's reducer.

# Middleware
Middleware wraps the base dispatch function. It allows the dispatch function to handle async actions in addition to actions
